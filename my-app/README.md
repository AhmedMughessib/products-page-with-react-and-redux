Product Page with Filters and Sorting Welcome to the Product Page with Filters and Sorting project! This project provides a user-friendly interface for browsing products, applying filters by category, and sorting products by name and prices. Users can also view the total sum of prices for the currently displayed products and the total number of products.

# Getting Started To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

2. Navigate to the my-app file

3. in the terminal use: 

npm install 

4. use the command: 

`npm start `
5. open the browser and the app will be running on 
http://localhost:3000





# Features
 1. Browse and explore a variety of products. 
 2. Filter products by category for easier navigation.
 3.  Sort products by name and prices to find what you're looking for. 
 4. See the total sum of prices for the products currently displayed.
 5. View the total number of products available.
 6. the product list is paginated
  
  # Technologies Used
  1. React: JavaScript library for building user 
   interfaces.
   2. Redux: State management for efficient data flow across components.
   3. RTK Query: Simplified data fetching and caching library for managing API requests.
   4. CSS: Styling and layout of the application. 




# Performance Optimization
1. Redux State Management: Utilized Redux to manage the application state, ensuring a centralized source of truth and consistent data flow throughout the app.

2. RTK Query for Data Management: Leveraged RTK Query to handle data fetching, caching, and synchronization with the backend API.

3. Efficient Sorting Algorithms: Implemented low time complexity sorting algorithms such as quick sort

4. Data Caching: Cached frequently used data to reduce the need for repeated API requests.

5. React Components: Designed and structured the application using modular React components. This approach minimizes unnecessary re-renders.
