Product Page with Filters and Sorting
Welcome to the Product Page with Filters and Sorting project! This project provides a user-friendly interface for browsing products, applying filters by category, and sorting products by name and prices. Users can also view the total sum of prices for the currently displayed products and the total number of products.

Getting Started
To run the application locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/product-page.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd product-page/my-app
Install dependencies using npm:

Copy code
npm install
Start the development server:

sql
Copy code
npm start
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

Features
Browse and explore a variety of products.
Filter products by category for easier navigation.
Sort products by name and prices to find what you're looking for.
See the total sum of prices for the products currently displayed.
View the total number of products available.
Technologies Used
React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Redux: State management for efficient data flow across components.
RTK Query: Simplified data fetching and caching library for managing API requests.
CSS: Styling and layout of the application.
npm: Package manager for installing and managing dependencies.
[Additional libraries or tools you may have used]
Performance Optimization
Redux State Management: Utilized Redux to manage the application state, ensuring a centralized source of truth and consistent data flow throughout the app.

RTK Query for Data Management: Leveraged RTK Query to handle data fetching, caching, and synchronization with the backend API. This helped in minimizing unnecessary network requests and optimizing data updates.

Efficient Sorting Algorithms: Implemented low time complexity sorting algorithms for sorting products by name and prices. This ensures quick and responsive sorting even with large datasets.

Data Caching: Cached frequently used data to reduce the need for repeated API requests, improving the application's responsiveness and overall performance.

React Components: Designed and structured the application using modular React components. This approach minimizes unnecessary re-renders and enhances the app's efficiency by rendering only the components that require updates.

File Structure
The project's file structure is organized as follows:
